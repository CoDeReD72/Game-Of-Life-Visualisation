# Conway's Game of Life - Cellular Automaton Visualisation

Conway's Game of Life is one of the most notable forms of cellular automaton, modelled somewhat on population, where a cell changes value dependant on those around it and rules such as:

1. _Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation._

2. _Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation._

3. _Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation_

4. _Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction_

## Future Work

There are many features which can be added to this project in particular including:

- ~~ Basic CSS Styling on the HTML page where the visualisation is generated ~~

- Recognition of common patterns

- User input of the starting cell values

- Colour indication of the rules each cell has recently followed

- Marking the cells as averages over the number of generations to create a different map


## Requires

- P5.js
