    <p>Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton where a grid of cells evolves over time based on a set of rules, determining if each cell lives, dies, or reproduces.</p>

    <h2> Rules of Conway's Game of Life </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Rule 1 - Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation</li>
      <li>Rule 2 - Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation</li>
      <li>Rule 3 - Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation</li>
      <li>Rule 4 - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction</li>
    </ul>
